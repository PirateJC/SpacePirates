Number of players - As many as you want!

Babylon Farkle is a press-your-luck dice rolling game where players compete to be the first person to reach the target score of 10,000 points.

On their turn, each player roles up to 6 dice, trying to score the maximum amount of points until they either role a "Farkle" or are satisfied with their score, not wanting to press their luck any further. 

Rolling a "Farkle" means that you have rolled dice that don't score any points at all. If you roll a "Farkle" while trying to add to a "banked" score, you sacrifice that score and your turn ends.

How to score:
On your turn, you have the choice of rolling 6 dice OR inheriting a score from the player before you, rolling the number of dice that they chose NOT to "bank". (more on this later)

Dice rolls are scored as follows:

* Each 5 = 50 points
* Each 1 = 100 points
* 3 1's = 100 points
* 3 2's  = 200 points
* 3 3's = 300 points
* 3 4's = 400 points
* 3 5's = 500 points
* 3 6's = 600 points
* "The French Lunch" = 4 of a kind = 1000 points
* "Soup Nuggets" = 5 of a kind = 2000 points
* "Banana Bread" = 6 of a kind = 3000 points
* "The Raanan Meme" = 1-6 straight = 1500 points
* "Seb's Guitar" = 3 pairs = 1500 points
* "Troll Gary Friday" = 4 of a kind + a pair = 1500 points
* "The Dad Joke" = 2 triplets = 2500 points

When rolling dice, you must "bank" at least 1 of them. "Banking" a dice means setting that dice aside and keeping track of its score value. After "banking" a dice, you reroll the remaining dice. Upon your second roll, you must repeat the process, "banking" at least 1 dice and adding that score value to your previously "banked" score. 

Story Time: David rolls 6 dice (1,3,3,4,5,5). He decides to "bank" the dice showing a 1, giving him a "banked" score of 100 points. He decides to press his luck and reroll the remaining 5 dice (2,2,2,4,6). He banks the 3 dice showing a 2, giving him 200 additional points to add to his initially banked 100 points. He now has a total of 300 points banked with the option to reroll 2 dice. Choose your own adventure (Option A - David's and idiot, Option B - You know that David guy is pretty smart!)

Option A - David decides to press his luck again rerolling his remaining 2 dice (2,4). David "Farkles." loses his "banked" 300 points, and hands all of the dice to the next player.

Option B - David decides not to press his luck. He adds his "banked" 300 points to his total score and hands the 2 remaining dice to the player on his left. 

When the player before you decides to cash in on their points, handing you their remaining dice, you have the choice to either keep their "banked" score and press your own luck by rolling the only remaining dice they hand you, OR rolling all 6 dice, removing any banked score and starting from zero.

When "banking" dice, those dice are no longer active. You cannot include them in when calculating scores from additional dice rolled.

As the game starts, you must press your luck until you have accumulated 500 points. Once you've achieved 500 points, you are free to stop pressing your luck at any time.
