Players 2-6

Space Pirate's is a table-top, dogfighting game closely modeled after X-Wing and modified from the open source project [Squadron Leader](https://squadronleader.netlify.app/).

The objective of the game is to be the last ship left flying, by reducing your opponent's Health to zero.

Each pilot will need:
* 1 ship card
* 4 stat cubes
* 1 ship token
* 4 altitude tokens
	
The pilots will share:
* 1 of each move template
* 1 range string
* 6 - d6 dice
* 1 first player token

The play area can be any large flat horizontal surface.

Each pilot will use stat cubes to assign values to their ship's stats on their ship card. Pilots assign the numbers 4,3,3,2 to the stats of their choice. 

For example:
* Attack - 3
* Defense - 2
* Speed - 3
* Health - 4

Determine who starts with a high roll of a d6. The starting pilot takes the first player token. Each pilot places their ship within 1 straight maneuver from the edge of the playing area and not closer than the range string to another pilot's token that has already been placed. If each pilot is controlling more than one plane, take it in turns until each token is placed down.

There are 2 stages in each round of Space Pirates, the Move Stage and the Attack Stage. Everyone moves during the Move stage, and then everyone Attacks during the Attack Stage. Here are how they work:

## Move Stage
* Pilots take turns moving their ship using the move template, up to their Speed value. Each move on the template has a cost of 1, 2 or 3 for the straight, bank & turn maneuvers respectively. The maneuver costs are indicated with arrows on the move template.
* To move, place the maneuver template at the front of the plane token, and move the plane to the other end of the template.
* The pilot may perform as many maneuvers as they like as long as they have enough Speed value to afford the maneuvers. For example a pilot with a Speed of 4 can execute 2 straight maneuvers & 1 bank maneuver (1 + 1 + 2).
* A pilot must move at least once each round. No standing still!
* If any part of a ship token goes off the board at the end of a maneuver, that ship is destroyed!

## Attack Stage
* The attacker declares which enemy ship they will attack.
* A pilot can only attack if the enemy ship is within in range. Range is determined with the two ends of the range string, ensuring both planes are within that distance.
* The defender must also be within the attackers firing arc which is represented by the outer 60° firing lines on the front of the token.
* The attacking pilot rolls a number of Attack dice equal to their chosen Attack value on their ship card.
* The defending pilot rolls a number of Defense dice equal to their chosen Defense value on their ship card.
* Each value of 4-6 rolled on the Attack dice counts as 1 damage. 
* Each value of 4-6 rolled on the Defense dice counts as a dodge and cancels out a hit. 
* The defender loses Health equal to the hits that haven’t been canceled out.
* If an attacking ship's forward firing lines, line up with a defending ship, the attacking pilot can roll 1 additional attack die.

A new round begins and the pilot who went second in the previous round now gets the first player token and goes first.


## Altitude

During the move phase, a pilot must move their ship at least once, spending at least 1 of their available Speed. A pilot may choose to store Speed to be used on a future turn in the form of altitude tokens. Altitude tokens are stored underneath ship tokens. 

For example, Sergio's ship has 3 available Speed. On his turn he choose to use 1 Speed to move forward in a Straight maneuver, and store his remaining 2 Speed using altitude tokens, giving him a total of 5 available Speed for use on his next turn.

A ship can store a maximum of 4 altitude tokens.

## Special Maneuvers

### Split S

This rule prevents a pilot from being stuck when they are being tailed by an opponent.
	• During the move phase, a pilot may declare they are executing a Split S maneuver and spend 3 altitude tokens to place their ship token at 180° at the end of the maneuver (facing the opposite direction to the way they were).
	• The Speed cost of the maneuver is double the normal cost of whichever maneuver template the player is using (the straight now costs 2, the bank now costs 4).
	• Players cannot perform a Split S and gain altitude in the same round.

### Barrel Roll

This rule rewards expertly skills pilots who can maneuver their plane into just the right place in the sky!
	• During the move phase a player may declare they are executing a Barrel Roll and execute either the 2 or 3 cost maneuver, but instead of orienting their plane along the new axis, their token will not rotate at all, and be traveling in the same direction.
	• The speed cost for a Barrel roll is twice whatever number is on the template (2 maneuver costs 4, 3 maneuver costs 6)
	• Players cannot perform a Barrel roll and gain altitude in the same round.
